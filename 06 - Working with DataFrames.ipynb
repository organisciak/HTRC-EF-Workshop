In Pandas, however, you can name these, so instead of A, B, C, or 1,2,3, columns and rows can be referred to by more descriptive names. You can also have multiple levels, so you're not bound by the two-dimensions of a table format. With a multi-indexed DataFrame, you can ask for `Page=24,section=Body, ...`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Up to this point, the token count DataFrames have been subsetted, but not modified from the way they were returned by the HTRC Feature Reader. There are many cases where one may want to perform aggregation or transformation based on subsets of data. To do this, Pandas supports the 'split-apply-combine' pattern (Wickham 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "Split-apply-combine refers to the process of dividing a dataset into groups (*split*), performing some activity for each of those groups (*apply*), and joining the new groups back together into a single DataFrame (*combine*).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/split-apply-combine.png\" width=\"500px\" alt=\"Graph demonstrating Split-Apply-Combine.\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/example-split-apply-combine.png\" width=\"600px\" alt=\"Example of Split-Apply-Combine, averaging movie grosses by director.\" />\n",
    "**Figure: Example of Split-Apply-Combine, averaging movie grosses by director.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Split-apply-combine processes are supported on DataFrames with `groupby()`, which tells Pandas to split by some criteria. From there, it is possible to apply some change to each group individually, after which Pandas combines the affected groups into a single DataFrame again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the following, can you tell what happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tl.groupby(level=[\"pos\"]).sum()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a count of how often each part-of-speech tag (\"pos\") occurs in the entire book.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Split* with `groupby()`: We took the token count dataframe that is set to `tl` and grouped by the part-of-speech (`pos`) level of the index. This means that rather than thinking in terms of rows, Pandas is now thinking of the `tl` DataFrame as a series of smaller groups, the groups selected by a common value for part of speech. So, all the personal pronouns (\"PRP\") are in one group, and all the adverbs (\"RB\") are in another, and so on.\n",
    "- *Apply* with `sum()`: These groups were sent to an apply function, `sum()`. Sum is an aggregation function, so it sums all the information in the 'count' column for each group. For example, all the rows of data in the adverb group are summed up into a single count of all adverbs. \n",
    "- *Combine*: The combine step is implicit: the DataFrame knows from the `groupby` pattern to take everything that the apply function gives back (in the case of 'sum', just one row for every group) and stick it together.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sum()` is one of many convenient functions [built-in](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html) to Pandas. Other useful functions are `mean()`, `count()`, `max()`. It is also possible to send your groups to any function that you write with `apply()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> groupby can be used on data columns or an index. To run against an index, use `level=[index_level_name]` as above. To group against columns, use `by=[column_name]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some examples of grouping token counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find most common tokens in the entire volume (sorting by most to least occurrences)\n",
    "  - `tl.groupby(level=\"token\").sum().sort_values(\"count\", ascending=False)`\n",
    "- Count how many pages each token/pos combination occurs on\n",
    "  - `tl.groupby(level=[\"token\", \"pos\"]).count()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Remember from earlier that certain information can be called by sending arguments to `vol.tokenlist()`, so you don't always have to do the grouping yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `sum`, the data is being reduced: only one row is left for each group. It is also possible to 'transform' a group, where the same number of rows are returned. This is useful if processing is necessary based on the group statistics, such as percentages. Here is an advanced example of transformation, a [TF\\*IDF](https://porganized.com/2016/03/09/term-weighting-for-humanists/) function. TF\\*IDF weighs a token's value to a document based on how common it is. In this case, it highlights words that are notable for a page but not the entire book."
